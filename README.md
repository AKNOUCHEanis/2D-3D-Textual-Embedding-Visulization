# 2D-3D-Textual-Embeddings-Visulizations

Text embeddings capture complex semantic relationships in high-dimensional spaces, making them challenging to interpret directly. By projecting these embeddings into 2D and 3D spaces, we gain several key benefits.

The notebook contains the following sections:
1. Textual Data. Exploring the dataset used in this study.
2. Textual Analysis. Examining key examples within the dataset.
3. Embedding Generation. Converting text into numerical representations.
4. Dimension Reduction. Reducing the embeddings dimension.
5. Visualization. Representing  textual relationships in 2D and 3D spaces

This medium article explores in detail the process of transforming raw textual data into insightful visualizations.
